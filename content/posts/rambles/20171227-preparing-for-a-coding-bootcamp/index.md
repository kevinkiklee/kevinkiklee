This guide is geared towards the readers that want to switch their careers in a short period of time through a coding bootcamp, and it contains actionable items that will increase your chance of attaining an entry-level software engineer position for $90k-$110k average salary within 6 months at one of the following companies or similar in NYC or SF:

> Google, Facebook, Amazon, Spotify, Netflix, Hulu, Slack, AirBnB, Box, DataDog, Meetup, Bonobos, Zola, Foursquare, SeatGeek, JP Morgan, Nasdaq, AMEX, The New York Times, CondÃ© Nast, Buzzfeed, Vox, Flatiron Health, Oscar Health, Quartet Health, AppNexus, Addepar, MediaMath, HelloFresh, Plated, Boxed, and more similar companies.
>
> *Please note that the above list is formulated from my limited knowledge of the companies that have hired coding bootcamp graduates in NYC.*

It is possible to become a software engineer in 6 months regardless of the background and experience, if you have the drive and the necessary skillset.

To accomplish this goal within a short timeframe, I highly suggest attending a coding bootcamp.  It is hard to become a developer in a condensed period of time without participating in an accelerator program.  That's all a coding bootcamp is; it is just one way to accelerate the process.  It is not some magical institution where you show up, and suddenly you are given a job.

Coding is hard.  Becoming job-ready in 6 months for a top-tier company is a daunting task.  Be prepared to work.  I studied 12 to 14 hours every single day for 6 months.  That is the key theme throughout the guide: **You must study**.  There is no shortcut to the process.

#### Note to self-learners

I would like to write more about this topic in the future.  Maybe even develop an open-source coding bootcamp curriculum.  This is a good start:

* The frontend module of [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org).
* EDX CS50 - [Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
* Front-end framework such as [React](https://reactjs.org) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org)
* Back-end framework such as [Node/Express](https://expressjs.com/) or [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
* Database such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* Algorithms & data structures ([example](#study))
* [Portfolio project](#if-you-do-not-have-a-portfolio)

This guide is not a coding bootcamp promotion article.  A bootcamp is just the optimal path, but it is absolutely possible to achieve the same goal through self-learning.  However, expect it to be significantly more difficult, and it will require a much longer period of time.  Self-learning is a topic I would like to write about in the future.  If you have the means, including money, housing and time, I recommend attending a good coding bootcamp.

## Choosing the right coding bootcamp

CS graduates, coding bootcampers and self-learners have flooded the market.  Your job application will get lost in the sea of applications.  You want to attend a bootcamp that will prepare you well for the challenges ahead.  Look for a coding bootcamp with rigorous selection standards.  There must be a filter to keep the quality of the curriculum at a high level.

Thoroughly investigate what the graduates say on various coding bootcamp review websites.  From what I have seen, the reviews are genuine (and I have seen my classmates leave reviews).  Look for a place where the students consistently comment that it was challenging.

If you have a chance to visit the location, try to check out is the projects of the current or the previous group.  This is the best indicator of the curriculum's strength.

Disregard any physical superficialities.  You are there to learn, not to sip on a latte after your meditation break.  I studied in a painted white box, packed shoulder-to-shoulder, and fought over chairs.  About 90% of my classmates had an offer for $90k average within 3 months after the completion.  Do not be drawn by silly amenities.

You can sip on that cold brew on tap after you get the job.

## Preparing for a coding bootcamp

Before starting a bootcamp, you should complete the front-end module of [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org).  It took me about a month, and there is no better curriculum available for free online.  That is the first actionable item of this guide:

> **Complete the FreeCodeCamp front-end module**

I am flat out telling you what to do: **Study JavaScript**.  I personally started from Ruby, and I love Ruby with all my heart, but the JavaScript job market is significantly bigger.  It is the universal web language.  The language you learn does not matter in the end, but in the beginning, it does in a sense that you have a limited amount of time.  Ruby is easier and more elegant, but for employment purposes, JavaScript is by far the highest in demand.

Now, go study.  Don't spend too much time socializing and networking where you talk about how you are going to become a software engineer.  6 months from now, they won't remember you, and you won't remember them.

The coding bootcamp should have a prep material.  After finishing FreeCodeCamp and the prep material, look into the framework you will be studying.

> **Complete a brief tutorial of the framework taught in the course**

For Rails, [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) is the best guide.  For React, [React.js](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorial on the official website is great.  Even if you do not fully understand what is going on, at least copy-paste along to become familiar with the terminologies and the process.  You will learn better when it's the second time you are looking at the material.

This is not something extra you should do.  This is mandatory.  There are too many coding bootcamp grads.  Ensure that you stand out by studying the material beforehand.  Give yourself the best chance of success.  This action item has a very high return on investment.

## Attending a coding bootcamp

Study.  Dedicate the next 3 months of your life to nothing but studying.  How many times have I used the word `study` in this guide?  =D

I am a military veteran, and I attended the hardest Army bootcamp at Infantry Basic Combat Training in Ft. Benning, Georgia.  Take it from someone who went to a real bootcamp:  a coding bootcamp is just as hard.  In the military, during the constant times of physical misery, you can turn your brain off.  You cannot do that at a coding bootcamp, and the stress of pushing your brain to the limit for prolonged hours is just as tiring.  Eat well and sleep well.
