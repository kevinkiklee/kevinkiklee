This guide is focused on providing actionable items that will increase your chance of attaining the entry-level software engineer position for $90k-$110k average salary within 6 months.

Is it possible to become a software engineer from 0 in 6 months?  Yes, I have taken this path, and I come from a very non-traditional background.

I disagree with the myth that everyone can become a developer.  This is a marketing ploy.  Coding is hard.  To become job-ready in 6 months is a daunting task.  Be prepared to work.  I studied 12-14 hours every single day for 6 months.

I highly suggest attending a coding bootcamp.  It is very hard to accomplish this in such a condensed period of time without participitating in an accelerator program.  That's all a coding bootcamp is.  It is a means to accelerate the process, but it is still a challenging task.  It is not some magical institution where you show up, and suddenly you are given a job.

The guide has two sections:

* #### Coding Bootcamp
  The first section is geared towards someone who is interested in entering the field.  This section will describe how to start the process.
* #### Job Search
  The second section is for someone who has just finished a coding bootcamp, and is actively seeking a job.  This section provides you with concrete guidelines on what you have to study and build.

The entire process should take approximately 6 months.  The actionable items are highlighted in a blue block.

# Coding Bootcamp

This guide is not a coding bootcamp promotion article.  A bootcamp is just the optimal path, but it is absolutely possible to achieve the same goal through self-learning.  However, expect it to be significantly more dificult, and it will require a much longer period of time.  Self-learning is a topic I would like to write about in the future.  If you have the means, including money, housing and time, I recommend attending a good coding bootcamp.

## Choosing the right coding bootcamp

CS graduates, coding bootcampers and self-lerners have flooded the market.  Your job application will get lost in the sea of applications.  You want to attend a bootcamp that will prepare you well for the challenges ahead.

Right off the bat, ignore the ones without a selection process.  Not everyone can become job-ready in 6 months.  There must be a filter to keep the quality of the curriculum at a high level.  Also, look for a program that removes students if they cannot keep up.

Thoroughly investigate what the graduates say on various coding bootcamp review websites.  From what I have seen, the reviews are genuine (and I have seen my cohortmates leave reviews).  Look for a place where the students consistently comment that it was challenging.

If you have a chance to visit the location, the most important thing to check out is the projects.  If they steer you towards few hand-selected top projects, politely insist on seeing the portfolio projects by the current or previous group.  This is the best indicator of the curriculum's strength.

Disregard any physical superficialities.  You are there to learn, not to sip on a latte after your meditation break.  I studied in a painted white box, packed shoulder-to-shoulder, and fought over chairs.  About 90% of my classmates had an offer for $90k average within 3 months after the completion.  Do not be drawn by silly amenities.

## Preparing for a coding bootcamp

Before starting a bootcamp, you should complete the front-end module of [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org).  It took me about a month, and there is no better curriculum available for free online.  That is the first actionable item of this guide:

> **Complete the FreeCodeCamp front-end module**

I am flat out telling you what to do: **Study JavaScript**.  I personally started from Ruby, and I love Ruby with all my heart, JavaScript job market is significantly bigger.  It is the universal web language.  The language you learn does not matter in the end, but in the beginning, it does.  Ruby is easier and more elegant, but for employment purposes, JavaScript is by far the highest in demand.

Now, go study.  Don't spend too much time socializing and networking where you talk about how you are going to become a software engineer.  6 months from now, they won't remember you, and you won't remember them.  Go study.

The coding bootcamp should have a prep material.  After finishing FreeCodeCamp and the prep material, look into the framework you will be studying.

> **Complete a brief tutorial of the framework taught in the course**

For Rails, [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) is the best guide.  For React, [React.js](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) tutorials on the main website is the best.  Even if you do not fully understand what is going on, at least copy-paste along to become familiar with the terminologies and the process.  The bootcamp is significantly easier when it's the second time you are looking at the material.  Give yourself the best chance of success.

## Attending a coding bootcamp

Study.  Dedicate the next 3 months of your life to nothing but studying.  There is no shortcut to this process.  You will be asked difficult questions at interviews.  You do not want to be standing there embarrassed.  Your classmates will motivate you through the challenge.

I am a military veteran, and I attended one of the hardest bootcamps at Ft. Benning Infantry OSUT.  Take it from someone who went to a real bootcamp:  a coding bootcamp is just as hard.  In the military, during the constant times of physical misery, you can turn your brain off.  You cannot do that at a coding bootcamp, and the stress of pushing your brain to the max for prolonged periods of time is just as tiring.

Study.  How many times have I used the word `study` in this guide?  =D

# Job Search

Congratulations!  You just finished your coding bootcamp, and you have just reached the starting line!  The real challenge begins now.  Here are the topics you should have basic understanding of:

* Web application architecture
  * Front-end framework (React+Redux)
  * Back-end framework (Node/Rails)
  * Database (SQL/MongoDB)
  * Local development environment setup
* JavaScript fundamentals
  * Callbacks and first-class functions
  * Closure
  * Context and `this`
  * `bind`, `apply`, and `call`
  * `let`, `const`, and `var`
  * `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`
  * DOM traversal and manipulation
* CS fundamentals
  * Time/Space Complexity - `O(n)`
  * Object-oriented programming
  * Recursion
* Other fundamentals
  * Version control system (Git)
  * Flexbox / Responsive CSS
  * Test-driven development
  * How to Google

## Build

> **Build or polish the portfolio project**

You should have built a project at your coding bootcamp.  Polish it.  It is the only proof of your skillset.

When you meet someone at a networking event, you want to point them to your project and its GitHub.  Since you are at a coding event, there is a good chance that there are laptops everywhere.  Type in your URL, and provide a concrete and absolute proof of what you can do.

The aesthetics matter.  The first person seeing your application will most likely not be an engineer, but the recruiter who does not understand how cleverly you solved a `N+1` query problem.  The recruiter will play around on your app for about 30 seconds to a minute (I have measured this with Google Analytics).  Make sure that your project is presentable and visually pleasing.

#### If you do not have a portfolio

Clone a well-known web application such as Slack, Spotify, AirBnB, Facebook, Strava, or Asana.  For example, I cloned Slack - [SlackOff](http://www.slackoff.today/).

You have 15 seconds to explain your project during the phone screen.  You do not want to waste it by saying "I made this dating app that matches people based on the side of the bed they sleep on.  I swear, it's based on science!"  You want to say "I cloned Slack using React/Redux front-end, Rails/Postgres back-end, and Pusher websocket API for live chat functionality."

You are not trying to get on Shark Tank.  You are a coder, and it is not your job to come up with creative app ideas.  Focus on what your actual job is:  code.  Also, you are not a designer.  By cloning a well-established app, you don't have to worry about the design.  It is already using UX/UI that has been refined by the best professionals.

> **Study algorithms and data structures fundamentals**

* Algorithms
  * Bubble sort
  * Merge sort
  * Quick sort
  * Quick sort in place

> **Study JavaScript fundamentals**

* Callbacks and first-class functions
* Closure
* Context and `this`
* `bind`, `apply`, and `call`
* `let`, `const`, and `var`
* `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`
* DOM traversal and manipulation

> **Study web application architecture**

* What happens when a user enters a URL in the browser?
* How would you design a multiplayer tic tac toe game for 10 million users per month?
* How would you design a URL shortener like [bit.ly](https://bit.ly)?
* What is a load balancer?
* Where are the caching layers?
* What database sharding strategies are there?

## Apply

> **Apply to at least 40 companies a week**

This is purely a numbers game.

During WW2, there was a study conducted in finding the factor that produced the most casualty.  It was not the training.  It was not the equipment either.  It was simply the number of bullets fired.  The same approach works very well in the job search.

Your goal is to apply to 8 companies a day.  Dedicate your morning and early afternoon (and work on your portfolio project or study Algo&DS in the afternoon).  Split your piles into two:  a copy-paste pile for the companies you aren't interested in, and an interested pile where you will spend time crafting your cover letter.

Apply for every single entry/mid-level positions.  Never reject yourself from the company.  You have no idea what the company is looking for.

This is the most difficult phase.  You will have heartbreaks.  You will go for weeks without hearing back from anywhere.  You will question yourself whether you are really hireable or not.  Keep going and keep improving yourself.

I hope this guide can provide some structure to your journey.  This guide is currently under construction, and will be constantly receiving updates.  If you would like to be notified when the final version is published please follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kevinkiklee)!
