I am specifically interested in what a programming language is and what it can do.  I realize that there will be no end, and at no point, I will have a clue of what is going on.  Therefore, I have accepted a simple truth that I will never actually understand what I am doing at any given point of time.</p>\n<p>I have been fortunate to enter the software engineering industry from a very non-traditional background.  I would like to share this knowledge on how to get your first software engineer job.  Quick answer?  I studied 12-14 hours every single day for 6 months.  Well, it is a little more involved than that, and I want to write a helpful and actionable guide.  A part of the process is understanding the fundamentals of key algorithms and data structures.  The process is not easy.</p>\n<p>Also, this blog is a documentation of my growth for my own purposes.  A year from now, I imagine I will be laughing hard at my own ignorance.  And again the year after that, and it goes on.</p>\n<p>Anyway, enough rambling.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kevin</li>\n</ul>',timeToRead:1,excerpt:"I have just started in the field, and I have realized very quickly that I have no idea what I am doing, and I imagine that I will feel thisâ€¦",frontmatter:{title:"I have no idea what I am doing",cover:"/covers/facepalm.png",date:"2017-12-27",category:"rambles",tags:["ramble"]},fields:{slug:"/i-have-no-idea-what-i-am-doing"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/i-have-no-idea-what-i-am-doing",path:"/rambles/i-have-no-idea-what-i-am-doing"}}}});
