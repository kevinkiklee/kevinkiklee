Polish it.  It is the only proof of your skillset.</p>\n<p>When you meet someone at a networking meetup, you want to point them to your project and its GitHub.  Since you are at a coding event, there is a good chance that there are laptops everywhere.  Type in your URL, and provide a concrete and absolute proof of what you can do.</p>\n<p>The aesthetics matter.  Most likely, the first person seeing your application will be a recruiter who does not understand how cleverly you solved a <code>N+1</code> query problem.  The recruiter will play around on your app for about 30 seconds to a minute (I have measured this with Google Analytics).  Make sure that your project is presentable and visually pleasing.</p>\n<h4 id="if-you-do-not-have-a-portfolio"><a href="#if-you-do-not-have-a-portfolio" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>If you do not have a portfolio</h4>\n<p>Clone a well-known non-trivial web application such as Slack, Spotify, AirBnB, Facebook, Strava, or Asana.  For example, I cloned Slack - <a href="http://www.slackoff.today/">SlackOff</a>.</p>\n<p>You have 15 seconds to explain your project during the phone screen.  You do not want to waste it by saying "I made this dating app that matches people based on the side of the bed they sleep on.  I swear, it\'s based on science!"  You want to say "I cloned Slack using React/Redux front-end, Rails/PSQL back-end, and Pusher websocket API for live chat functionality."</p>\n<p>You are not trying to get on Shark Tank.  You are a coder, and it is not your job to come up with creative app ideas.  Focus on what your actual job is:  code.  Also, you are not a designer.  By cloning a well-established app, you don\'t have to worry about the design.  It is already using UX/UI that has been refined by the best professionals.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Build or polish the portfolio project</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id="study-material"><a href="#study-material" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Study Material</h2>\n<p>Here are the topics you should have basic understanding of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Web application architecture</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Front-end framework (React+Redux)</li>\n<li>Back-end framework (Node/Rails)</li>\n<li>Database (SQL/MongoDB)</li>\n<li>Local development environment setup</li>\n<li>REST architecture</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>JavaScript fundamentals</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Callbacks and first-class functions</li>\n<li>Closure</li>\n<li>Context and <code>this</code></li>\n<li><code>bind</code>, <code>apply</code>, and <code>call</code></li>\n<li><code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, and <code>var</code></li>\n<li><code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code>, and <code>filter</code></li>\n<li>DOM traversal and manipulation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CS fundamentals</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time and space complexity i.e. <code>O(n)</code></li>\n<li>Object-oriented programming</li>\n<li>Recursion</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other fundamentals</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Version control system (Git)</li>\n<li>Flexbox / Responsive CSS</li>\n<li>Test-driven development</li>\n<li>How to Google</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above is the bare minimum.

After the phone screen, they told me they were going to ask me an architecture question at the on-site.  I was concerned.  I knew nothing about the subject, and there was to be absolutely no BS-ing allowed since my interviewer was a MIT CS grad.  I frantically Googled trying to learn this substantial subject over a weekend (<em>lol</em>).</p>\n<p>Then I finally came across this article:  <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/distsys.html">Scalable Web Architecture and Distributed Systems</a> (Chapter 1 of the book).  I read it several times that weekend, and attempted my best to digest the material.  I whiteboarded what I learned to a friend twice.  It worked.  I was asked <em>"How would you design a multiplayer tic tac toe game for 10 million users per month?"</em>.  I applied the concepts learned from the article to solve the problem.  And I got the offer.</p>\n<p>Use the above article as the starting point, and start Googling each concept.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Study architecture and scalability fundamentals</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id="applying-to-jobs"><a href="#applying-to-jobs" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Applying to jobs</h2>\n<p>This is purely a numbers game.</p>\n<p>During WW2, there was a study conducted in finding the factor that produced the most casualties.  It was not the training.  It was not the equipment either.  It was simply the number of bullets fired.  The same approach works very well in the job search.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to apply to 8 companies a day.  Dedicate your morning to submitting applications, then work on your portfolio project or study Algo&#x26;DS in the afternoon.  Split your piles into two:  a copy-paste pile for the companies you aren\'t interested in, and an interested pile where you will spend time crafting your cover letter (like one of the companies listed above).</p>\n<p>Apply to every single entry/mid-level positions.  Never reject yourself from the company.  You have no idea what the company is looking for.</p>\n<p>This is the most difficult phase.  You will have heartbreaks.  You will go for weeks without hearing back from anywhere.  The impostor syndrome will surface, but remind yourself that there are real software engineers that cannot clone Slack.
