A bootcamp is just the optimal path, but it is absolutely possible to achieve the same goal through self-learning.  However, expect it to be significantly more difficult, and it will require a much longer period of time.  Self-learning is a topic I would like to write about in the future.  If you have the means, including money, housing and time, I recommend attending a good coding bootcamp.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"choosing-the-right-coding-bootcamp\\\"><a href=\\\"#choosing-the-right-coding-bootcamp\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Choosing the right coding bootcamp</h2>\\n<p>CS graduates, coding bootcampers and self-learners have flooded the market.  Your job application will get lost in the sea of applications.  You want to attend a bootcamp that will prepare you well for the challenges ahead.</p>\\n<p>Right off the bat, ignore the ones without a selection process.  Not everyone can become job-ready in 6 months.  There must be a filter to keep the quality of the curriculum at a high level.  Also, look for a program that removes students if they cannot keep up.</p>\\n<p>Thoroughly investigate what the graduates say on various coding bootcamp review websites.  From what I have seen, the reviews are genuine (and I have seen my classmates leave reviews).  Look for a place where the students consistently comment that it was challenging.</p>\\n<p>If you have a chance to visit the location, the most important thing to check out is the projects.  If they steer you towards few hand-selected top projects, politely insist on seeing the portfolio projects by the current or previous group.  This is the best indicator of the curriculum's strength.</p>\\n<p>Disregard any physical superficialities.  You are there to learn, not to sip on a latte after your meditation break.  I studied in a painted white box, packed shoulder-to-shoulder, and fought over chairs.  About 90% of my classmates had an offer for $90k average within 3 months after the completion.  Do not be drawn by silly amenities.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"preparing-for-a-coding-bootcamp\\\"><a href=\\\"#preparing-for-a-coding-bootcamp\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Preparing for a coding bootcamp</h2>\\n<p>Before starting a bootcamp, you should complete the front-end module of <a href=\\\"https://freecodecamp.org\\\">FreeCodeCamp</a>.  It took me about a month, and there is no better curriculum available for free online.  That is the first actionable item of this guide:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Complete the FreeCodeCamp front-end module</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I am flat out telling you what to do: <strong>Study JavaScript</strong>.  I personally started from Ruby, and I love Ruby with all my heart, but the JavaScript job market is significantly bigger.  It is the universal web language.  The language you learn does not matter in the end, but in the beginning, it does in a sense that you have a limited amount of time.  Ruby is easier and more elegant, but for employment purposes, JavaScript is by far the highest in demand.</p>\\n<p>Now, go study.  Don't spend too much time socializing and networking where you talk about how you are going to become a software engineer.  6 months from now, they won't remember you, and you won't remember them.</p>\\n<p>The coding bootcamp should have a prep material.  After finishing FreeCodeCamp and the prep material, look into the framework you will be studying.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Complete a brief tutorial of the framework taught in the course</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>For Rails, <a href=\\\"https://www.railstutorial.org/book\\\">Rails Tutorial</a> is the best guide.  For React, <a href=\\\"https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html\\\">React.js</a> tutorial on the official website is great.  Even if you do not fully understand what is going on, at least copy-paste along to become familiar with the terminologies and the process.  You will learn better when it's the second time you are looking at the material.</p>\\n<p>This is not something extra you should do.  This is mandatory.  There are too many coding bootcamp grads.  Ensure that you stand out by studying the material beforehand.  Give yourself the best chance of success.  This action item has a very high return on investment.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"attending-a-coding-bootcamp\\\"><a href=\\\"#attending-a-coding-bootcamp\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Attending a coding bootcamp</h2>\\n<p>Study.

You cannot do that at a coding bootcamp, and the stress of pushing your brain to the limit for prolonged hours is just as tiring.

After the phone screen, they told me they were going to ask me an architecture question at the on-site.  I was concerned.  I knew nothing about the subject, and there was to be absolutely no BS-ing allowed since my interviewer was a MIT CS grad.  I frantically Googled trying to learn this substantial subject over a weekend (<em>lol</em>).</p>\\n<p>Then I finally came across this article:  <a href=\\\"http://www.aosabook.org/en/distsys.html\\\">Scalable Web Architecture and Distributed Systems</a> (Chapter 1 of the book).  I read it several that weekend, and attempted my best to digest the material.  I whiteboarded what I learned to a friend twice.  It worked.  I was asked <em>\\\"How would you design a multiplayer tic tac toe game for 10 million users per month?\\\"</em>.  I applied the concepts learned from the article to solve the problem.  And I got the offer.</p>\\n<p>Use the above article as the starting point, and start Googling each concept.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"apply\\\"><a href=\\\"#apply\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Apply</h2>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Apply to at least 40 companies a week</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>This is purely a numbers game.</p>\\n<p>During WW2, there was a study conducted in finding the factor that produced the most casualties.

A bootcamp is just the optimal path, but it is absolutely possible to achieve the same goal through self-learning.  However, expect it to be significantly more difficult, and it will require a much longer period of time.  Self-learning is a topic I would like to write about in the future.  If you have the means, including money, housing and time, I recommend attending a good coding bootcamp.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"choosing-the-right-coding-bootcamp\\\"><a href=\\\"#choosing-the-right-coding-bootcamp\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Choosing the right coding bootcamp</h2>\\n<p>CS graduates, coding bootcampers and self-learners have flooded the market.  Your job application will get lost in the sea of applications.  You want to attend a bootcamp that will prepare you well for the challenges ahead.</p>\\n<p>Right off the bat, ignore the ones without a selection process.  Not everyone can become job-ready in 6 months.  There must be a filter to keep the quality of the curriculum at a high level.  Also, look for a program that removes students if they cannot keep up.</p>\\n<p>Thoroughly investigate what the graduates say on various coding bootcamp review websites.  From what I have seen, the reviews are genuine (and I have seen my classmates leave reviews).  Look for a place where the students consistently comment that it was challenging.</p>\\n<p>If you have a chance to visit the location, the most important thing to check out is the projects.  If they steer you towards few hand-selected top projects, politely insist on seeing the portfolio projects by the current or previous group.  This is the best indicator of the curriculum's strength.</p>\\n<p>Disregard any physical superficialities.  You are there to learn, not to sip on a latte after your meditation break.  I studied in a painted white box, packed shoulder-to-shoulder, and fought over chairs.  About 90% of my classmates had an offer for $90k average within 3 months after the completion.  Do not be drawn by silly amenities.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"preparing-for-a-coding-bootcamp\\\"><a href=\\\"#preparing-for-a-coding-bootcamp\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Preparing for a coding bootcamp</h2>\\n<p>Before starting a bootcamp, you should complete the front-end module of <a href=\\\"https://freecodecamp.org\\\">FreeCodeCamp</a>.  It took me about a month, and there is no better curriculum available for free online.  That is the first actionable item of this guide:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Complete the FreeCodeCamp front-end module</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I am flat out telling you what to do: <strong>Study JavaScript</strong>.  I personally started from Ruby, and I love Ruby with all my heart, but the JavaScript job market is significantly bigger.  It is the universal web language.  The language you learn does not matter in the end, but in the beginning, it does in a sense that you have a limited amount of time.  Ruby is easier and more elegant, but for employment purposes, JavaScript is by far the highest in demand.</p>\\n<p>Now, go study.  Don't spend too much time socializing and networking where you talk about how you are going to become a software engineer.  6 months from now, they won't remember you, and you won't remember them.</p>\\n<p>The coding bootcamp should have a prep material.  After finishing FreeCodeCamp and the prep material, look into the framework you will be studying.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Complete a brief tutorial of the framework taught in the course</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>For Rails, <a href=\\\"https://www.railstutorial.org/book\\\">Rails Tutorial</a> is the best guide.  For React, <a href=\\\"https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html\\\">React.js</a> tutorial on the official website is great.  Even if you do not fully understand what is going on, at least copy-paste along to become familiar with the terminologies and the process.  You will learn better when it's the second time you are looking at the material.</p>\\n<p>This is not something extra you should do.  This is mandatory.  There are too many coding bootcamp grads.  Ensure that you stand out by studying the material beforehand.  Give yourself the best chance of success.

Polish it.  It is the only proof of your skillset.</p>\\n<p>When you meet someone at a networking meetup, you want to point them to your project and its GitHub.  Since you are at a coding event, there is a good chance that there are laptops everywhere.  Type in your URL, and provide a concrete and absolute proof of what you can do.</p>\\n<p>The aesthetics matter.  Most likely, the first person seeing your application will be a recruiter who does not understand how cleverly you solved a <code>N+1</code> query problem.  The recruiter will play around on your app for about 30 seconds to a minute (I have measured this with Google Analytics).  Make sure that your project is presentable and visually pleasing.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"if-you-do-not-have-a-portfolio\\\"><a href=\\\"#if-you-do-not-have-a-portfolio\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>If you do not have a portfolio</h4>\\n<p>Clone a well-known non-trivial web application such as Slack, Spotify, AirBnB, Facebook, Strava, or Asana.  For example, I cloned Slack - <a href=\\\"http://www.slackoff.today/\\\">SlackOff</a>.</p>\\n<p>You have 15 seconds to explain your project during the phone screen.  You do not want to waste it by saying \\\"I made this dating app that matches people based on the side of the bed they sleep on.  I swear, it's based on science!\\\"  You want to say \\\"I cloned Slack using React/Redux front-end, Rails/PSQL back-end, and Pusher websocket API for live chat functionality.\\\"</p>\\n<p>You are not trying to get on Shark Tank.  You are a coder, and it is not your job to come up with creative app ideas.  Focus on what your actual job is:  code.  Also, you are not a designer.  By cloning a well-established app, you don't have to worry about the design.  It is already using UX/UI that has been refined by the best professionals.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"study\\\"><a href=\\\"#study\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Study</h2>\\n<p>You will be asked difficult questions at the interviews.  You do not want to be standing there embarrassed in front of the whiteboard.</p>\\n<p>Nobody hands out $90k+ out of the goodness of the heart.  They will ask you the same questions they ask fresh CS graduates.  The goal is to impress them: \\\"If someone who only started coding less than half a year ago can answer difficult questions better than someone who studied CS for 4 years, this person must have incredible potential.\\\"</p>\\n<p>The learning does not stop after a coding bootcamp (nor when you get a job).</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Study algorithms and data structures fundamentals</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Algorithms</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Bubble sort</li>\\n<li>Merge sort</li>\\n<li>Quick sort</li>\\n<li>Quick sort in place</li>\\n<li>Heap sort</li>\\n<li>Binary search</li>\\n<li>Depth-first and breadth-first tree search</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><strong>Data Structures</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Queue</li>\\n<li>Stack</li>\\n<li>Single and double linked list</li>\\n<li>Static and dynamic array <em>with ring buffer</em></li>\\n<li>Heap</li>\\n<li>Hash map</li>\\n<li>Binary search tree</li>\\n<li><em>Graph</em></li>\\n<li><em>LRU Cache</em></li>\\n<li><em>Trie</em></li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>** <em>Italics are optional</em></p>\\n<p>These are common whiteboard questions.  Pick one topic per day, and keep cycling through the list.  By the third time, you will get it.  Memorize the APIs of each subject.  For example, a <code>stack</code> has <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> operations.  A binary search tree has a <code>height</code> operation.</p>\\n<p>Try to solve it on your own first, then study the standard implementations.  These have been studied and researched by people far smarter than you and I.  Learn how they solved it.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Study JavaScript fundamentals</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Callbacks and first-class functions</li>\\n<li>Closure</li>\\n<li>Context and <code>this</code></li>\\n<li><code>bind</code>, <code>apply</code>, and <code>call</code></li>\\n<li><code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, and <code>var</code></li>\\n<li><code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code>, and <code>filter</code></li>\\n<li>DOM traversal and manipulation</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>These are some of the most common initial phone screen questions to filter candidates.  Be ready to smoothly explain these concepts at the drop of a dime.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Study web application architecture</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>What happens when a user enters a URL in the browser?</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Describe the entire process from the browser to your database, then back to the browser.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>How would you design a multiplayer tic tac toe game for 10 million users per month?</li>\\n<li>How would you design a URL shortener like <a href=\\\"https://bit.ly\\\">bit.ly</a>?</li>\\n<li>What is a load balancer?</li>\\n<li>Where are the caching layers?</li>\\n<li>What is a CDN and how does it work?</li>\\n<li>What is database sharding?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>These are some of the most important questions, but unfortunately, not all bootcamps teach them.  I have been asked architecture questions at three on-sites, and all resulted in an offer.  Being able to answer these questions is how you convert your on-site into an offer.</p>\\n<p>You are competing against hundreds of other coding bootcamp grads for the same position.  You need a way to distinguish yourself from the pack.</p>\\n<p>True story:  I was at an on-site for an amazing company.  After the phone screen, they told me they were going to ask me an architecture question at the on-site.  I was concerned.  I knew nothing about the subject, and there was to be absolutely no BS-ing allowed since my interviewer was a MIT CS grad.  I frantically Googled trying to learn this substantial subject over a weekend (<em>lol</em>).</p>\\n<p>Then I finally came across this article:  <a href=\\\"http://www.aosabook.org/en/distsys.html\\\">Scalable Web Architecture and Distributed Systems</a> (Chapter 1 of the book).  I read it several that weekend, and attempted my best to digest the material.  I whiteboarded what I learned to a friend twice.  It worked.  I was asked <em>\\\"How would you design a multiplayer tic tac toe game for 10 million users per month?\\\"</em>.  I applied the concepts learned from the article to solve the problem.  And I got the offer.</p>\\n<p>Use the above article as the starting point, and start Googling each concept.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"apply\\\"><a href=\\\"#apply\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Apply</h2>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Apply to at least 40 companies a week</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>This is purely a numbers game.</p>\\n<p>During WW2, there was a study conducted in finding the factor that produced the most casualties.  It was not the training.  It was not the equipment either.  It was simply the number of bullets fired.  The same approach works very well in the job search.</p>\\n<p>Your goal is to apply to 8 companies a day.  Dedicate your morning to submitting applications, then work on your portfolio project or study Algo&#x26;DS in the afternoon.  Split your piles into two:  a copy-paste pile for the companies you aren't interested in, and an interested pile where you will spend time crafting your cover letter (like one of the companies listed above).</p>\\n<p>Apply to every single entry/mid-level positions.  Never reject yourself from the company.  You have no idea what the company is looking for.</p>\\n<p>This is the most difficult phase.  You will have heartbreaks.  You will go for weeks without hearing back from anywhere.  The impostor syndrome will surface, but remind yourself that there are real software engineers that cannot clone Slack.  Keep going and the next thing you know you will be getting ready to start your new job.</p>\\n<h1 id=\\\"have-fun\\\"><a href=\\\"#have-fun\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Have Fun!</h1>\\n<p>I hope this guide can provide some structure to your journey.
